# Hospital-Management-System

This project is based on OOP concepts and has been coded in Java.

It integrates all the information regarding patients, doctors, appointments, facility details, laboratory details and Medicine details, etc. into one software .It allows us the ability to optimize and digitize all the processes within the institution, which will help to improve customer service, reduce process costs, streamline the search of medical records, bills, patients, doctors, etc.; thus, having a database of each module implemented.
